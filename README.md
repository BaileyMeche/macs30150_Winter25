# MACS 30150 – Winter 2025

**Perspectives on Computational Modeling for Economists**
University of Chicago – MACSS-Econ Program

## Course Overview

This repository contains student submissions and code for **MACS 30150: Perspectives on Computational Modeling for Economists**, a Winter 2025 graduate-level course in the Master of Arts in Computational Social Science – Economics (MACSS-Econ) track at the University of Chicago.
The course introduces students to modern computational techniques used to analyze macroeconomic models. Students apply both economic theory and numerical methods to simulate, solve, and interpret a range of dynamic economic environments, from simple representative agent models to more complex heterogeneous agent models.
The repository includes solutions to assignments, model implementations, and applied exercises completed throughout the course.
